# Project Overview: AI-Agent-Based InterpreCoach (V.1.2)

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed operational project overview for the next-generation, AI-agent-based version of InterpreCoach (V.1.2). This new version will leverage a microservice architecture and a team of AI agents to provide a more powerful and flexible solution for real-time interpretation assistance.

## 2. System Architecture

The AI-agent-based InterpreCoach will be built on a microservice architecture. This will allow for greater scalability, flexibility, and resilience. The system will be composed of the following microservices:

*   **Audio Service:** This service will be responsible for capturing and processing audio from the user's microphone.
*   **Transcription Service:** This service will be responsible for transcribing the audio into text.
*   **Translation Service:** This service will be responsible for translating the text into the target language.
*   **Terminology Service:** This service will be responsible for identifying and looking up terminology.
*   **Note-Taking Service:** This service will be responsible for storing and retrieving the user's notes.
*   **Insights Service:** This service will be responsible for generating insights about the user's performance.

## 3. AI Agents

The AI-agent-based InterpreCoach will use a team of AI agents to provide real-time assistance to the user. Each agent will be responsible for a specific task, such as:

*   **Transcription Agent:** This agent will be responsible for transcribing the audio into text.
*   **Translation Agent:** This agent will be responsible for translating the text into the target language.
*   **Terminology Agent:** This agent will be responsible for identifying and looking up terminology.
*   **Note-Taking Agent:** This agent will be responsible for storing and retrieving the user's notes.
*   **Insights Agent:** This agent will be responsible for generating insights about the user's performance.

## 4. Data Handling

The AI-agent-based InterpreCoach will be designed to handle sensitive data, such as PII and PHI, in a secure and compliant manner. All data will be encrypted in transit and at rest. The system will also be designed to comply with all applicable data privacy regulations, such as HIPAA.

## 5. User Interface

The user interface for the AI-agent-based InterpreCoach will be a web extension that integrates into the user's interpreting platform. The UI will be designed to be simple, intuitive, and easy to use. It will provide the user with real-time access to all of the features of the system.

## 6. Project Timeline

The AI-agent-based InterpreCoach will be developed in an agile manner. The project will be divided into a series of sprints, with each sprint lasting two weeks. The first sprint will focus on developing the core infrastructure of the system. The subsequent sprints will focus on developing the individual microservices and AI agents.

## 7. Project Team

The AI-agent-based InterpreCoach will be developed by a team of experienced software engineers and AI specialists. The team will be led by a project manager who will be responsible for ensuring that the project is completed on time and within budget.
