*   **Terminology:** Interpreters must be familiar with a wide range of terminology, which can be difficult to keep up with.
*   **Accuracy:** Interpreters must be accurate in their translations, as even small errors can have serious consequences.

## 3. The Solution

The AI-agent-based InterpreCoach is a web extension that integrates into the user's interpreting platform to provide real-time assistance. It's like having a co-pilot in the cockpit with you, helping you to be more accurate and efficient.
